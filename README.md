## Why

Three failure modes repeatedly kill Claude Code sessions. `crucible` refuses to ship past any of them without a user-approved gate.

- **Repeated mistakes** — the same bug gets rediscovered every session because the correction never leaves working memory.
- **Tacit-knowledge evaporation** — project conventions, team decisions, and "that was wrong" moments never get written down.
- **No six-axis meta-loop** — Claude Code plugins typically automate *one* of brainstorm/plan/verify/compound; none enforce all six axes (Structure · Context · Plan · Execute · Verify · Improve) with a hard gate.
- **Auto-memory noise** — plugins that write memory automatically pollute future context with low-signal entries no one curated.
- **Skipped verification** — skipping the Verify axis is usually a one-keystroke mistake; `crucible` makes it a release blocker unless you explicitly acknowledge the risk.

## Install

`crucible` is a zero-dependency Claude Code plugin (`bash` + `jq` only). Drop the plugin directory into a Claude Code plugins path and the five slash commands register automatically.

```bash
# Option A — direct copy into Claude Code plugins
cp -r crucible ~/.claude-plugin-crucible

# Option B — clone into a plugins directory
git clone https://github.com/<owner>/crucible.git ~/.claude/plugins/crucible
```

Runtime requirements: `bash` (≥ 4), `jq` (≥ 1.6), `uuidgen`, `flock`. No Python or Node. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup) for the full development environment.

## Skills (5)

- `/brainstorm` — Feature brainstorming with a 3-lens clarify pass (vague · unknown · metamedium). Emits a requirements doc at `.claude/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}-requirements.md`.
- `/plan` — Hybrid Markdown + YAML-frontmatter plan built from a requirements doc. Includes acceptance criteria, evaluation principles with weights, and exit conditions.
- `/verify` — Artifact scoring with `qa-judge` (promote ≥ 0.80, retry 0.40–0.80, reject ≤ 0.40), Ralph Loop retries, and Charter Preflight.
- `/compound` — Promotion gate for repeated patterns, user corrections, and session-wrap summaries. Only user-approved candidates reach `.claude/memory/`.
- `/orchestrate` *(Stretch)* — End-to-end pipeline that chains the four skills above with CP-0 through CP-5 disk checkpoints for crash-safe resume.

## 6-Axis Harness

| # | Axis | What it enforces |
|---|------|------------------|
| 1 | **Structure** | Plugin layout, manifest integrity, slash-command registration |
| 2 | **Context** | `SessionStart` hook + `using-harness` guidance + `MEMORY.md` injection |
| 3 | **Plan** | Hybrid Markdown + YAML artifacts that humans and Evaluators both parse |
| 4 | **Execute** | Scoped skills, hook-validated prompts, SHA256-pinned payloads |
| 5 | **Verify** | `qa-judge` scoring · Ralph Loop · 3-stage Evaluator · grey-zone fallback |
| 6 | **Improve** | `/compound` promotion gate → `tacit/`, `corrections/`, `preferences/` memory |

Enforcement scope per skill is defined in [final-spec §3.5](./.claude/plans/2026-04-19/03-design/final-spec.md). `--skip-axis N` is permitted, but `--skip-axis 5` additionally requires `--acknowledge-risk` — skipping verification is an explicit release blocker.

## Example

**Single-skill call (`/verify` standalone):**

```bash
/verify .claude/plans/2026-04-20-dark-mode-plan.md --axis 5
# → qa-judge report:
#    {"score": 0.86, "verdict": "promote",
#     "dimensions": {"completeness": 0.9, "correctness": 0.85, ...},
#     "differences": [...],
#     "suggestions": [...]}
# → axis 5 PASS, artifact promoted.
```

**Full pipeline (`/orchestrate`):**

```bash
/orchestrate "add dark mode toggle to settings panel"
# → CP-0: brainstorm   → requirements.md
# → CP-1: plan         → plan.md (Markdown + YAML)
# → CP-2: verify       → qa-judge report
# → CP-3: compound     → promotion gate (user y/N/e/s)
# → CP-4: artifact link bundle
# → CP-5: experiment-log.yaml committed
```

If `/orchestrate` crashes between checkpoints, re-invocation resumes from the last CP written to disk — no rework.
